## Exercise

Team up in groups of 2 or 3 and take turns working on the following problems. Pretend you are in an interview setting:
- Keep talking!
- Ask questions (to the instructors, or to your teammates)
- Consider starting with an example, showing the expected outputs for sample inputs
- Consider writing pseudocode before Java to make your steps clear to both you and the interviewer

#### Requirements

Take turns working through these problems on the whiteboard. It's OK if you don't finish them all. Make as much progress as you can.

Today's problems are from [Cracking the Coding Interview](https://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-Programming-Questions/dp/098478280X), which is a great resource for whiteboarding and interview preparation.

1. A _magic index_ in an array of n integers `A[0...n-1]` is defined to be an index `i` such that `A[i] == i`. Given a **sorted** array of **distinct** integers, write a method to find a magic index, if one exists, in array A.

	Follow-up: Can you solve this problem using recursion? Hint: given what we know about the input array, can you determine if one half of the array _cannot_ contain a magic index?

2. Write a method to return all permutations of a string of unique characters.

	Hint: you don't always have to return the value of a recursive call immediately. Sometimes you might want to make the recursive call, modify the result, then return that.


#### Deliverable

No deliverable - just practice working through problems out loud on a whiteboard
